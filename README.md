# cpp-v8-typescript-example
Showcase how to integrate C++ with TypeScript through V8 library.

## Prerequisites
- CMake
- gcc, clang or MSVC
- V8 library
- Node with npx and TypeScript module globally installed

## Potential usages
Videogame scripting, high performance applications and low latency applications.
Otherwise is probably better to create two separated applications in C/C++ and Node.js connected through gRPC or similar.
